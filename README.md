# Influencer_kartr Setup Guide

This repository contains a script to clone and set up the [Influencer_kartr](https://github.com/Shadowmage-commits/Influencer_kartr.git) project.

## Prerequisites

Before running the setup script, make sure you have the following installed:
- Git
- Appropriate package manager (npm, yarn, pip, composer, etc. depending on the project)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository or download the `setup.sh` script
2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

## What the Script Does

The `setup.sh` script performs the following actions:
1. Clones the Influencer_kartr repository
2. Detects the type of project (Node.js, Python, PHP, etc.)
3. Installs the required dependencies using the appropriate package manager
4. Provides guidance on additional setup steps, if needed

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during setup:

1. **Git Clone Fails**: Verify your internet connection and that the repository URL is correct
2. **Dependency Installation Fails**: Ensure you have the correct package manager installed and up-to-date
3. **Permission Issues**: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to write to the target directory

## After Setup

Once the setup is complete, refer to the project's own documentation (README.md or similar) for instructions on how to run the application.

## Running the Project with a Virtual Environment

To ensure your project dependencies are isolated and managed properly, use a Python virtual environment. Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. Create a virtual environment
Run this command in your project root directory to create a virtual environment named venv:

This command creates a folder venv containing a standalone Python environment.
   ```bash
      python3 -m venv venv
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment

On macOS/Linux:
   ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
   ```
On Windows (PowerShell):
   ```powershell
      .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```
On Windows (Command Prompt):
   ```text
      .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
   ```
## After activation, your shell prompt will change to indicate the environment is active, e.g.:
   (venv) $

3. Install project dependencies
With the virtual environment activated, install the required Python packages from requirements.txt:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the application
Finally, run your Python program (e.g., main.py):
   python main.py

5. Deactivate the virtual environment (when done)
To exit the virtual environment and return to your system Python, run:
   deactivate

Summary command (macOS/Linux)
You can combine steps 1â€“4 in one line:
   python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt && python main.py

This setup keeps your project dependencies isolated and ensures consistent runtime behavior across different machines.
